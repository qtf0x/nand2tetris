2. I read the relevant sections of the textbook for about an hour, spent maybe
another two on the actual project.

3. Well, this was super cool! I'm still kind of in shock at how simple the
design for the CPU ended up being. I really wouldn't have expected to be able
to do instruction decoding and execution with just half a dozen chips (and some
basic ORs, ANDs, and NOTs, of course). Not to mention the *actual* Computer
chip, which is literally 3 lines of HDL. Also, I definitely got my answer to
how the jump instructions work, and it's literally just a boolean expression :)
