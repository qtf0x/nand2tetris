2. I read the relevant sections of the textbook for about an hour, spent maybe
another 8 on the actual project.

3. Well, I fixed all the memory errors from the first version. Sorry about
that; I tested on my own machines as well as Isengard and Alamode, but none of
them ever actually showed any signs that something was wrong. Anyway, fun
project! I'll be digging into the source code for the textbook authors'
implementation, because I am baffled at how theirs is 5-7x times faster (on my
machine) than mine, even though theirs is written in Java and mine in C
(obviously I know that's not all there is to program speed, I just thought it
was interesting).
