2. I read the relevant sections of the textbook for about an hour, spent maybe
another on the actual project.

3. I really like the barebones simplicity of this ISA. With real-world ones
like RISC-V or (god forbid) x86, you end up having to learn a lot of
instructions. It's impressive that the textbook authors were able to design the
CPU to do everything it needs to with just two instructions. Though I do wonder
how things like D;JLE work, since I would think you'd need multiple
instructions for that. I guess I'll find out next chapter.
