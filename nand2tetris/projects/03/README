2. I read the relevant sections of the textbook for about an hour, spent maybe
two or three on the actual project.

3. I thought it was interesting that the PC was the most difficult chip to
design, conceptually, even though it's job is quite simple. I also feel like
the book's requirement that there be a precedence to the operations (reset
supercedes load if both are set, etc.) was not clear and is not how I would
design the chip. Since it only makes sense to set one of the control pins at a
time, why not just XOR them and send that to the registers load pin? Then, if
multiple control pins are set, which isn't really supposed to happen, we assume
something went wrong and don't touch the register's state. This feels safer and
more intuitive to me.
